# Advent of Code 2019 Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) challenges.

The code in this repository is written entirely in C++ and is setup as a ROS Melodic package. This setup encourages C++14 practice and usage of the ROS libraries.
